- Cross-platform compatibility
- Screen sharing and remote control

#### 🌐 **Web-based Remote Desktop**
- Custom web VNC viewer in browser
- No additional software required
- Built-in session controls (fullscreen, Ctrl+Alt+Del)

#### 💻 **SSH Terminal**
- Copies SSH command to clipboard
- Command-line access for advanced users
- Terminal-based remote management

## 🚀 How It Works

### **User Flow**
1. User clicks "Actions" → "Remote" on any machine
2. Visual Remote Access modal opens with connection options
3. System retrieves machine credentials from database
4. User selects preferred connection method (RDP/VNC/Web/SSH)
5. Connection established using stored credentials
6. Remote session opens in appropriate client/viewer

### **Technical Flow**
1. Frontend calls `/api/remote-access/direct` endpoint
2. Backend queries `machines` table for credentials
3. Connection details prepared based on selected method
4. Response includes connection URLs/files/commands
5. Frontend handles connection launch (download/open/copy)

## 📱 User Experience

### **Modern Interface**

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### **Credential Security**
- Uses existing encrypted password storage
- No plain-text credential transmission
- Database-driven authentication
- Secure session token generation

### **Connection Security**
- IP address validation against database
- Machine status verification before connection
- Native protocol encryption (RDP/VNC/SSH)
- Proper session cleanup and timeouts
