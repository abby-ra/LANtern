## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

üéØ **Solved a Real IT Challenge: Remote Machine Management**

**The Problem:** IT admins struggle with efficient remote access to multiple machines, often juggling different tools and manual credential management.

**My Solution: LANtern** - A unified web platform that:

‚úÖ Manages all machines from one dashboard
‚úÖ Provides instant remote desktop access (RDP, VNC, SSH)
‚úÖ Handles Wake-on-LAN with enhanced reliability
‚úÖ Stores encrypted credentials securely
‚úÖ Monitors real-time machine status
‚úÖ Supports bulk operations on machine clusters

**Impact:** Reduced remote access setup from 5+ minutes to 30 seconds per machine!

Built with React.js frontend, Node.js backend, and MySQL database. Implemented custom network protocols and real-time monitoring.

**Next Steps:** Adding mobile responsiveness and advanced security features.

## Option 4: Technical Deep-Dive Focus

‚öôÔ∏è **Deep Dive: Building LANtern's Network Management Features**

Recently shipped a network management system with some interesting technical challenges:

**üîå Enhanced Wake-on-LAN Implementation:**
```javascript
// Multi-packet transmission for reliability
const sendMultipleWolPackets = async (macAddress, broadcastAddress) => {
    const addresses = [broadcastAddress, '255.255.255.255', machine.ip_address];
    const packetCount = 3;
    // Send 9 total packets across 3 addresses
}
```

**üñ•Ô∏è RDP Shadow Mode Integration:**
‚Ä¢ Implemented non-intrusive desktop viewing
‚Ä¢ Auto-login using encrypted database credentials
‚Ä¢ Support for both shadow (view-only) and control modes

**üìä Real-time Status Monitoring:**
‚Ä¢ Custom ping implementation with response time tracking
‚Ä¢ WebSocket connections for live status updates
‚Ä¢ Database logging of all network events

**üîê Security Features:**
‚Ä¢ Encrypted credential storage in MySQL
‚Ä¢ CORS protection for API endpoints
‚Ä¢ Session-based authentication for remote access

**Performance Optimizations:**
‚Ä¢ Parallel execution for cluster operations
‚Ä¢ Connection pooling for database queries
‚Ä¢ Optimized network packet transmission

The system now handles 50+ machines simultaneously with sub-second response times!
